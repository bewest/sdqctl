[STOP FILE CREATION TEST]

You are being tested for the stop file automation control feature.

## Your Task

Create the stop file specified in the Automation Control section of this prompt.
Use the `create` tool to write the file with valid JSON content.

The file should contain:
```json
{
  "reason": "Stop file creation test - verifying agent can create automation stop signals",
  "needs_review": true,
  "test_id": "stop-file-elicit-${DATE}"
}
```

After creating the file, confirm you created it and show the filename you used.

This tests whether the agent correctly receives and acts on the ${STOP_FILE} instruction.
