PROLOGUE This analysis is part of a pre-release verification workflow.
PROLOGUE Current version: $(git describe --tags)
PROLOGUE Target repositories: nightscout-connect, nightscout-roles-gateway

PROMPT Analyze recent API changes in the following files:
CONTEXT @lib/api/*.js
CONTEXT @lib/server/*.js
CONTEXT @CHANGELOG.md

PROMPT For each API change, document:
1. What changed (endpoint, method signature, response format)
2. Whether it's breaking or backward-compatible
3. Version introduced
4. Migration guide reference (if breaking)

PROMPT Compare current API with previous release:
CONTEXT @docs/api-v3.md

PROMPT Generate a structured report with:
- Breaking-Change: Yes/No for each API
- Dependency-Impact: Which downstream repos/clients are affected
- Migration-Guide: Link to docs (or "NEEDED" if missing)
- Severity: Low/Medium/High/Critical

PROMPT Output format:
```markdown
