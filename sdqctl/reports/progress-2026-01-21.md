## Cycle 1, Prompt 1

**Done.** Updated `reports/run-improvements-focus.md` and committed (743684a).

**Key updates:**
- **R2 bug confirmed** at `run.py:469-475` - early return before output capture on stop+failure
- **Added research question** about session message persistence on early return
- **Reprioritized**: R2 fix now Priority 1 (was Priority 3 as test verification)

**Next 3 taskable areas:**
1. **R2 - RUN Failure Context Fix** (~20 min) - Move output capture before early return
2. **Q1 - Subprocess Refactor** (~30 min) - Extract `_run_subprocess()` helper
3. **E1 - RUN Output Limit** (~45 min) - Add `RUN-OUTPUT-LIMIT` directive
