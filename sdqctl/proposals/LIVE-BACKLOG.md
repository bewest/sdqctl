During backlog grooming please make sure these two items are added as important tasks to accomplish soon.
* Let's add a documentation review/audit to find documentation that may be outdated and create a plan to update and maintain the needed documentation with progress or lessons learned.
* The backlog is gettting too large to read, please organize it so that old material will be archived correctly and it is usable as a cross-domain tracker.
