# progress-tracker.conv - Synthesis cycle for self-improving workflows
#
# A workflow that uses sdqctl to improve sdqctl itself.
# Reads findings from test discovery, works on the most impactful item,
# documents barriers/lessons, and points to next work areas.
#
# Usage:
#   cd /path/to/sdqctl
#   sdqctl cycle progress-tracker.conv \
#     --prologue reports/test-discovery-2026-01-20.md \
#     --adapter copilot
#
# This is a "synthesis cycle" because:
# 1. It analyzes sdqctl's own codebase
# 2. It uses sdqctl features (PROLOGUE, RUN, template vars) to do so
# 3. Its output becomes input for the next iteration (state relay pattern)
# 4. Each cycle synthesizes improvements and updates the backlog

PROMPT ## Task Selection

You have received a test discovery report via --prologue containing prioritized issues.

**Your task:** Select the SINGLE most impactful item to work on this cycle.

Selection criteria (in order):
1. P0 items that block other work
2. P1 items that affect multiple commands (consistency issues)
3. Items where the fix is well-understood from the report

**Output format:**
```
### Selected Task
**ID:** [P0-X or P1-X]
**Title:** [Brief description]
**Impact:** [Why this is most important now]
**Files to modify:** [List specific files]
**Estimated complexity:** [Low/Medium/High]
**Dependencies:** [What must exist first]
```

If P0-3 (no unit tests) was already resolved by the test commit, skip to P1 items.
Review the RUN output above to see current test file status.

# === Cycle 2: Implementation ===
PROMPT ## Implementation

Based on your selected task, implement the fix now.

**Requirements:**
1. Edit the relevant source files to make the changes
2. Make minimal, surgical changes - modify only what's necessary
3. Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
4. Run tests to verify your changes work: `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`
5. If tests pass, commit your changes with a descriptive message

**Do NOT just describe or show code changes. Actually edit the files.**

If you encounter blockers that prevent implementation, document them clearly and move on.

# === Cycle 3: Document and Queue ===
PROMPT ## Progress Documentation

Summarize this work session and queue next priorities.

**Section 1: Completed Work**
- What was implemented this session
- Files modified with line counts
- How to verify the changes

**Section 2: Barriers and Lessons**
- Any blockers encountered
- Workarounds applied
- Lessons for future sessions

**Section 3: Next Three Priorities**
For each of the next 3 most impactful items:

| Priority | ID | Title | Rationale | Est. Effort |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | P?-? | ... | Why next | Low/Med/High |
| 2 | P?-? | ... | Why next | Low/Med/High |
| 3 | P?-? | ... | Why next | Low/Med/High |

**Section 4: Updated Backlog Status**
- P0 remaining: X items
- P1 remaining: X items  
- P2 remaining: X items
- Test coverage: X files, Y lines

**Section 5: Next Session Command**
Provide the exact command to run the next improvement session:
```bash
sdqctl cycle examples/workflows/progress-tracker.conv \
  --prologue reports/[updated-report].md \
  --adapter copilot
```
