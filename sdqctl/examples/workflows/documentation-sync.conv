PROMPT Verify that documentation is in sync with the codebase.

PROMPT Check for these documentation issues:
  
  1. **Outdated API documentation**
     - Function signatures that don't match the code
     - Missing new parameters or options
     - Deprecated features still documented as current
  
  2. **Missing documentation**
     - Public APIs without documentation
     - Configuration options not explained
     - New features without user guides
  
  3. **Broken code examples**
     - Examples that won't run with current API
     - Incorrect import paths
     - Missing dependencies
  
  4. **Inconsistent terminology**
     - Different names for the same concepts
     - Outdated naming conventions
     - Inconsistent capitalization

PROMPT For each issue found, provide:
  - Location (file:line or section)
  - Current documentation text
  - What the code actually does
  - Suggested fix

PROMPT Generate a documentation sync report with severity ratings:
  - Critical: Completely wrong information
  - High: Outdated after breaking changes
  - Medium: Minor inconsistencies
  - Low: Style or formatting issues
